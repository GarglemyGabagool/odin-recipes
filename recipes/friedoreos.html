        <p>Deep-fried Oreos are a carnival favorite where I grew up. 
            Oreos get dipped into pancake batter and fried -yummy! 
            You can do this with or without a deep fryer.</p>
            <div class="header"><h2>Ingredients</h2></div>
            <ul>
                <li>2 quarts vegetable oil for frying</li>
                <li>1 cup milk</li>
                <li>1 large egg</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons vegetable oil</li>
                <li>1 cup pancake mix</li>
                <li>1 (18 ounce) package cream-filled chocolate sandwich cookies (such as OreoÂ®)</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Whisk milk, egg, and 2 teaspoons of vegetable oil in a large bowl until smooth. Stir in the pancake mix until no dry lumps remain.</li>
                <li>Dip cookies into batter, one at a time, and carefully place into hot oil. Fry in batches, 4 or 5 at a time, until cookies are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate before serving.</li>
            </ol>
